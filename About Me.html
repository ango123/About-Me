	<h1 style="text-align:center; font-size:200%"> BRIEF INTRODUCTION </h1>
	<p style="text-align:center;font-size:150%"> I was born on February 29th, 2000. I currently attend Lowell High School and will become a senior starting the next school semester. I am the youngest child in my family. My hobbies are reading, drawing, and playing video games. When I'm not doing hours of homework, you can see me do either one of those three things. </p>
